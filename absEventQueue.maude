*** Try to model event queues ...
--- Event: input port + "tag" + value
---     Note: we like to count "down" so the tag
---       is not absolute time, but remaining time.
--- Note also: we need super-dense time, although we use
---       natural numbers as time domain.


--- Note: also actions need to be scheduled and put into event queue.
---   we guess

fmod EVENT is
  protecting REACTOR-ID .
  protecting ACTION-TRIGGER .
  protecting LF-ABS-VALUE-TIME .

  --- Single events:
  sort Event .
  op event : ReactorId ActionTrigger Value -> Event [ctor] .
endfm


---NOTE: currently not used
fmod TIMED-EVENT is
  protecting TIME .
  protecting EVENT .

  sort TimedEvent .   --- ???
  op _inTime_ : Event Time -> TimedEvent [ctor] .   ---  needed?
endfm


fmod TAG is
  protecting NAT .
  protecting TIME .

  vars T1 T2 : Time .
  vars MS1 MS2 : Nat .
 
  sort Tag .    --- Superdense time
  op tag : Time Nat -> Tag [ctor] .

  op _<_ : Tag Tag -> Bool .
  eq tag(T1, MS1) < tag(T2, MS2) = T1 lt T2 or ((T1 equals T2) and MS1 < MS2) .
endfm


fmod TAGGED-EVENTS is
  protecting EVENT .
  protecting TAG .

  sort TaggedEvents .
  op _at_ : Events Tag -> TaggedEvents [ctor] .

  sort Events . 
  subsort Event < Events .
  op noEvent : -> Events [ctor] .
  op __ : Events Events -> Events [assoc comm id: noEvent ctor] .
endfm


omod ABS-EVENT-QUEUE is
  protecting TAGGED-EVENTS .

  --- At the moment, we do NOT deal with hierarchical
  --- models, so that an input port is uniquely identified by
  --- reactorId . portId

  class EventQueue | queue : EQueue .  --- class according to majority vote

  --- the cons constructor for EQueue is not defined here!
  sort EQueue .
  subsort TaggedEvents < EQueue .
  op empty : -> EQueue [ctor] .

  var ZERO : ZTime .
  var NZT : NzTime .
  var EVENTS : Events .
  var QUEUE : EQueue .

  ---NOTE: not declared here!
  op insert : TaggedEvents EQueue -> EQueue .

  --- note events could also be 'actions'
  --- NOTE: these are our educated guesses ....
  op schedule : Events Time EQueue -> EQueue .
  eq schedule(EVENTS, NZT, QUEUE)  = insert(EVENTS at tag(NZT, 0), QUEUE) .
  eq schedule(EVENTS, ZERO, QUEUE) = insert(EVENTS at tag(zero,1), QUEUE) .
